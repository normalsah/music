Something

Intro: F, Eb, G, C

C                        Cmaj7
Something in the way she moves
C7                        F      (D String = 3, 2)
Attracts me like no other lover

Something in the way she woos me

Am                        AmMaj7
I don't want to leave her now
Am7                    D9
You know I believe and how

F, Eb, G, C

C                          Cmaj7
Somewhere in her smile she knows
C7                         F      (D String = 3, 2)
That I don't need no other lover
D                D7         G
Something in her style that shows me

Am                      AmMaj7
Don't want to leave her now
Am7                    D9
You know I believe and how

F, Eb, G, A

A             C#m/G#          F#m  F#m7  A/E
You're asking me will my love grow
        D     G       A    (E String = 4, 3, 2, 1, 0)
I don't know, I don't know
A          C#m/G#           F#m  F#m7  A/E
You stick around now it may show
        D     G       C    (A String = 2, 1, 0, E String = 4, 3)
I don't know, I don't know
