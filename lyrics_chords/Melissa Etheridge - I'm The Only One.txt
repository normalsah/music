[Verse 1:]

G 
Please baby can't you see, my mind's a burnin' hell. 
I got razors a rippin' and tearin' and strippin' 
My heart apart as well 
Tonight you told me, that you ache for something new 
And some other woman is lookin' like something 
That might be good for you 


[Chorus:]

Am                           D                Dsus4
Go on and hold her 'till the screaming is gone 
Am                           D                      Dsus4
Go on believe her when she tells you nothing's wrong 
G                         F                        E
I'm the only one, who'll walk across the fire for you 
G                         F                      E 
I'm the only one, who'll drown in my desire for you 
Am                                     C
It's only fear that makes you run, the demons that you're hiding from 
      F                    C                  G 
When all your promises are gone. I'm the only one... 


[Verse 2:]

G 
Please baby can't you see, I'm trying to explain 
I've been here before and I'm locking the door 
And I'm not going back again. 
Her eyes and arms and skin won't make it go away 
You'll wake up tomorrow and wrestle the sorrow 
That holds you down today 


[Chorus:]

Am                           D                Dsus4
Go on and hold her 'till the screaming is gone 
Am                           D                      Dsus4
Go on believe her when she tells you nothing's wrong 
G                              F                        E
But, I'm the only one, who'll walk across the fire for you 
G                              F                     E
And, I'm the only one, who'll drown in my desire for you 
Am                                     C
It's only fear that makes you run, the demons that you're hiding from. 
     F                     C                  G 
When all your promises are gone, I'm the only one...

Am                                     C
It's only fear that makes you run, the demons that you're hiding from

When all your promises are gone, I'm the only one...
