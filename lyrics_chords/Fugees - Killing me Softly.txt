Killing me Softly
-----------------
*Chorus*(this song begins with the chorus)
   Em                        Am
Strumming my pain with his fingers,
   D                     G
Singing my life with his words.
   Em                      A
Killing me softly with his song,
             D          C
Killing me softly with his song;
              G          C
telling my whole life, with his words,
           F                   E
Killing me softly -- with his song.

Verse 1
Am7         D
I heard he sang a good song,
G             C
I heard he had a style,
Am7       D                    Em        Em7
And so I went to see him and listen for awhile.
Am7           D
And there he was this young boy
G           B7
A stranger to my eyes.

*Chorus*
  Em                        Am
Strumming my pain with his fingers,
   D                     G
Singing my life with his words.
   Em                      A
Killing me softly with his song,
             D          C
Killing me softly with his song;
              G          C
telling my whole life, with his words,
           F                   E
Killing me softly -- with his song.
 

Verse 2
Am7        D
I felt all flushed with fever,
G           C
Embarassed by the crowd.
Am7         D
I felt he found my letters,
Em                    Em7
And read each one out loud.
Am7           D
I prayed that he would finish,
G             B7
But he just kept right on.

*Chorus*
  Em                        Am
Strumming my pain with his fingers,
   D                     G
Singing my life with his words.
   Em                      A
Killing me softly with his song,
             D          C
Killing me softly with his song;
              G          C
telling my whole life, with his words,
           F                   E
Killing me softly -- with his song.

Verse 3
Am7        D
He sang as if he knew me,
G           C
In all my dark despair.
Am7            D
And then he looked right through me,
Em             Em7
As if I wasn't there.
Am7      D
He just kept right on,
G         B7
Singin' clear and strong.

*Chorus* repeat

  Em                        Am
Strumming my pain with his fingers,
   D                     G
Singing my life with his words.
   Em                      A
Killing me softly with his song,
             D          C
Killing me softly with his song;
              G          C
telling my whole life, with his words,
           F                   E
Killing me softly -- with his song.

Em      Am              D        G
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Em              A
La la la la la  la,
D       C        G      C    F    E
Woh la,  woh la, la la la la.

*Chorus*
  Em                        Am
Strumming my pain with his fingers,
   D                     G
Singing my life with his words.
   Em                      A
Killing me softly with his song,
             D          C
Killing me softly with his song;
              G          C
telling my whole life, with his words,
           F                   E
Killing me softly -- with his song.
