Intro:
Am  E7  C  Dm  Am/C  E7  Am  E7
Am  E7  C  Dm  Am/C  E7  Am  E7-Stop!


     Am          E7
Your eyes may be whole
       C         Dm
But the story Im told
        Am/C        E7       Am      E7-Stop!   
Is your heart is as black as night

     Am            E7
Your lips might be sweet
          C         Dm
Such that I cant compete
         Am/C        E7       Am        E7
But your heart is as black as night


  Dm                              Am
I dont know why you came along at such a perfect time
    Dm                          E7
But if I let you hang around Im bound to lose my mind


           Am           E7
Cause your hands may be strong
        C            Dm
But the feelings all wrong
     Am/C        E7       Am        E7
Your heart is as black as night

I dont know why you came along at such a perfect time

But if I let you hang around Im bound to lose my mind


           Am           E7
Cause your hands may be strong
        C            Dm

Your heart is as black
